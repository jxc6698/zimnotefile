====== 获取当前程序的路径 ======
Created 星期二 20 一月 2015


Mac OS X: _NSGetExecutablePath() (man 3 dyld)
Linux: readlink /proc/self/exe
Solaris: getexecname()
FreeBSD: sysctl CTL_KERN KERN_PROC KERN_PROC_PATHNAME -1
FreeBSD if it has procfs: readlink /proc/curproc/file (FreeBSD doesn't have procfs by default)
NetBSD: readlink /proc/curproc/exe
DragonFly BSD: readlink /proc/curproc/file
Windows: GetModuleFileName() with hModule = NULL


The portable (but less reliable) method is to use argv[0]. Although it could be set to anything by the calling program, by convention it is set to either a path name of the executable or a name that was found using $PATH.

Some shells, including bash and ksh, set the environment variable "_" to the full path of the executable before it is executed. In that case you can use getenv("_") to get it. However this is unreliable because not all shells do this, and it could be set to anything or be left over from a parent process which did not change it before executing your program.
